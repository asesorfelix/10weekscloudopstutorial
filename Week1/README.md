## Deliverables 📦

In this challenge, you are expected to produce the following deliverables:

### 1. Architecture Diagram 🏗️
A comprehensive architecture diagram illustrates how the various cloud services and components fit together. You can use tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or any other diagramming tool of your choice to create the diagram. 📊

### 2. Blog or GitHub Readme 📄
You should document your progress and steps taken during the challenge. This documentation could be in the form of a blog post or a GitHub Readme file. Include code snippets, configuration files, and explanations for each step. Share your insights and learning experiences. 📝
