# Week 3 Challenge: Implement a 2-tier architecture in AWS, Azure, or GCP using Terraform 🚀

## Objective
This project task aims to leverage infrastructure as code (IaC) best practices to create a reusable and shareable infrastructure setup. Our focus is on promoting modularity, flexibility, and maintainability.

## Key Guidelines

### 1. Leverage Custom Modules
Build custom modules to break your infrastructure code into reusable and shareable components. This approach not only organizes your code but also allows other team members to easily incorporate and adapt the components for their specific needs.

### 2. Use Variables and Data Sources
Please implement variables and data sources in your IaC code to enhance flexibility and maintainability. Variables make it easier to adapt and modify configuration settings, while data sources allow you to retrieve information from external sources to inform your infrastructure.

### 3. Remote State File
You can store your state file remotely. This practice enhances collaboration, security, and version control of your IaC code. Consider using your infrastructure's remote state storage service, such as Terraform Cloud or AWS S3.

### 4. Security First
Keep security in mind throughout your IaC development. Ensure that your infrastructure is configured with appropriate security measures and adhere to best practices for secure and compliant deployments.

By following these guidelines, you'll create an infrastructure setup that is efficient, highly adaptable, and secure.

Feel free to document your IaC code and any specific implementation details in your GitHub README to make it easier for others to understand and use your work.


## Deliverables 📦

In this challenge, you are expected to produce the following deliverables:

### 1. Architecture Diagram 🏗️
A comprehensive architecture diagram illustrates how the various cloud services and components fit together. You can use tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or any other diagramming tool of your choice to create the diagram. 📊

### 2. Blog and GitHub Readme 📄
You should document your progress and steps taken during the challenge. This documentation could be in the form of a blog post and reference your public GitHub repo. Include code snippets, configuration files, and explanations for each step. Share your insights and learning experiences. 📝

**Here's a suggested outline for your documentation:**

- **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the challenge and its objectives. 📋
- **Step-by-Step Guide**: Provide a detailed completed task walkthrough. Include code examples and configurations where applicable. 💡
- **Challenges Faced**: Discuss any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. 🤔
- **Key Takeaways**: Share your key learnings from this week's challenge. 🧐
- **Resources**: List any helpful resources or references you used. 📚

### 3. Screen Recording or Live Website 📽️
Optionally, you can create a screen recording or deploy a live website demonstrating your implementation. This adds an interactive element to your documentation and can be valuable to your portfolio. 🎥
